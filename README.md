## Abstract

Accurately drawing non–planar 3D curves in immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is indispensable for many precise 3D tasks. However, due to lack 
of physical support, limited depth perception, and the non–planar nature of 3D curves, it is challenging to adjust mid–air strokes to 
achieve high precision. Instead of creating new interaction techniques, we investigated how task geometric shapes and input modalities 
affect precision–first drawing performance in a within– subject study (n = 12) focusing on 3D target tracing in commercially available VR 
headsets. We found that compared to using bare hands, VR controllers and pens yield nearly 30% of precision gain, and that the tasks with 
large curvature, forward–backward or left–right orien- tations perform best. We finally discuss opportunities for designing novel 
interaction techniques for precise 3D drawing. We believe that our work will benefit future research aiming to create usable toolboxes for 
precise 3D drawing.

## The Dataset

To encourage future research, we have made our dataset publicly available. Although the focus of this work lies on the analysis of spatial 
and temporal features of the drawn traces, we also record participants participant’s drawing behaviors. This unlocks future investigations 
for analyzing precision–first 3D drawing from the perspective of participants’ drawing behaviors. Example key research questions include: 
how do participants explore and observe during precision–first 3D drawing? and how do participants hold the tools? etc. This is one–step 
beyond the current method of analysis that only focuses on the temporal and spatial features of what participant drew.

A more detailed description of the dataset along with the dataset itself can be found on the About page of our website.
